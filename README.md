# Automatic-Summarization
Extractive-based summarization using a neural network. This is my final project for the Statistical Approaches to Natural Language Processing course, Fall 2016.

The implementation of the MLP is found in /src/neural.nets.py.
Corpus can be supplied on request. Acheieved around 88-89% accuracy on email summarization - though this is not the end-all metric for ML systems. 

If interested, confusion matrix results can be supplied on request.
